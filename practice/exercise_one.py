'''
Practice Problem: Write a Python function that accepts two integer numbers. If the product of the two numbers is less than or equal to 1000, return their product; otherwise, return their sum.

Exercise Purpose: Learn basic control flow and the use of if-else statements. Understand how code decisions change output based on a mathematical threshold.

Given Input:

Case 1: number1 = 20, number2 = 30
Case 2: number1 = 40, number2 = 30
Expected Output:

The result is 600
The result is 70

'''

def arithmeticOrProduct(x, y): 
    #find the product of x and y
    product = x * y
    #checks if product is less than or equal to 1000
    if product <= 1000:
        return product
    else:
        return x + y
#Testing out the output
print(arithmeticOrProduct(10,20))
print(arithmeticOrProduct(20,40))
print(arithmeticOrProduct(20,60))
