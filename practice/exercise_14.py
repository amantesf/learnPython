'''Practice Problem: Write a program to find how many times the substring “Emma” appears in a given string.

Exercise Purpose: Text analysis and pattern matching are core pillars of programming. This exercise introduces searching for a “needle in a haystack,” a fundamental concept for building search engines or data validation tools.

Given Input:

str_x = "Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer"'''

str_x = "Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer"
count = str_x.count("Emma") #counter for Emma
print(f'Emma appeared {count} times')
