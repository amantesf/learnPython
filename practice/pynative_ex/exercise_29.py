'''Exercise 29. Word Length Analysis
Practice Problem: Create a list of 5 words. Write a loop that iterates through the list and prints each word alongside its character count.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise introduces “Metadata Extraction.” Often, you aren’t just interested in the data itself, but in its properties. In web development, this logic is used to validate if a user’s password or username meets specific length requirements.

Given Input: words = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]

Expected Output:

Apple - 5 Banana - 6 Cherry - 6 Date - 4 Elderberry - 10
'''
words = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]
word_count = list(map(lambda word: (word, len(word)), words))

print(word_count)
