'''Practice Problem: Write a program to check if a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome number remains the same when its digits are reversed (e.g., 121, 545).

Exercise Purpose: This exercise teaches “Algorithmic Reversal.” While strings are easy to reverse in Python, reversing a number mathematically using the modulo (%) and floor division (//) operators deepens understanding of how integers are stored in memory and how to manipulate digits individually.

Given Input: number = 121
Expected Output:

Original number 121
Yes. given number is palindrome number

'''
number = 121
str_number = str(number)

if str_number[::-1] == str_number:
    print(f'Original number {number}')
    print(f'Yes. Given number is palindrome number')
else:
    print(f'Original number {number}')
    print(f'No. Given number is not palindrome number')
