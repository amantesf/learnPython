'''Practice Problem: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number (e.g., 5!) using a for loop.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise explores “Mathematical Accumulation.” A factorial (e.g., 5! = 5*4*3*2*1) requires you to maintain a running product across multiple iterations, which is a core pattern in scientific computing.

Given Input: number = 5

Expected Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
'''

number = 5
factorial = 1
for i in range(1,number + 1):
    factorial *= i
        

print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial}")
